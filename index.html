    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer"> For the client to secure their website from web security attacks,
       I would advise them to use firewall so that they are protected from any malware attacks.
       By implementing HTTPS which ensures that communication between my server,
        other users and the client's server is encrypted by using TLS or SSL.
        I would advise the client to add a two factor authenticaton 
        that can be used in logging in to the website to avoid third party attackers. In addition,
       minimizing the acceptance of cookies from unnecessary websites would also help the client to remain protected.By backing up the website and its data regulary,
        the website would be quickly restored in case there is any breach.Like any website that is being logged in by different employees, 
        it would be highly essential to educate every user about the website security attacks for maximum protection</p>
